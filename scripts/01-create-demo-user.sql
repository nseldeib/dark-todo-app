-- Demo User Creation Instructions
-- 
-- Since we cannot directly insert into auth.users from the SQL editor,
-- please create the demo user manually through the sign-up page:
--
-- 1. Go to your app's sign-up page
-- 2. Use these credentials:
--    Email: demo@todoapp.dev
--    Password: DarkTodo2024!
-- 3. The app will automatically create the user profile and seed demo data
--
-- This script is kept for reference but doesn't need to be executed.

SELECT 'Demo user should be created through the sign-up page' as instruction;
