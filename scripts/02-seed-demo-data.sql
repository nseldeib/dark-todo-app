-- Insert demo user (this will be handled by Supabase Auth, but we'll create sample tasks)
-- The demo user should be created through the sign-up process with:
-- Email: demo@todoapp.dev
-- Password: DarkTodo2024!

-- Note: This script assumes the demo user has been created through auth
-- We'll insert sample tasks for the demo user ID that will be created
-- You'll need to run this after creating the demo user account

-- Sample tasks for demo user (replace with actual user ID after demo account creation)
-- These will be inserted via the application after demo user signs up
